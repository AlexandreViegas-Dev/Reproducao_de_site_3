        <p>I photograph very instinctively. I see how it is taken like that.

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>During your engagement shoot or portrait session I will assist and direct you through posing and expression to get you and your fiancée / partner comfortable in front of the camera so we can incorporate both posed and natural moments on your special day.</p>
        <p>From a fashion forward shoot to a more reserved traditional style, I am here for you.</p>
        <p>I love trying creative things in a fast paced environment. I adapt to any given situation and try to bring the beauty out that is already there. This is your day, lets have fun with it and make memories.</p>
        <p>I have won a boatload of awards for my work, and I’m grateful for every single one of them, but I’ve always been unsure of whether I earned them or whether the jury was rigged. By now I am literally addicted to making photos…for which there is no known cure, except to make more.</p>
